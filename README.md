# Algorithmic Fairness in Machine Learning

This repository explores the trade-offs between accuracy and fairness in machine learning models, focusing on standard and fairness-aware logistic regression models. The project implements and evaluates methods for improving model fairness, using Pareto Efficiency to balance accuracy and fairness.

## Key Results

- **Best Standard Model:** Achieved an accuracy of **0.75309** with an Equal Opportunity Difference (EOP) of **-0.61785**.
- **Best Fairness-Aware Model:** Using reweighting, achieved an accuracy of **0.72029** with an EOP of **-0.03176**, demonstrating a significant reduction in bias.
- **Pareto Efficiency Selection:** Identified models that optimized both accuracy and fairness:
  - **Standard Model:** Accuracy **0.75239**, EOP **-0.65693**
  - **Fairness-Aware Model:** Accuracy **0.72029**, EOP **-0.03176**

## Key Findings
  - The experiments reveal that fairness-aware models, particularly those using reweighing techniques, can significantly reduce bias (as measured by EOP) without a substantial loss in accuracy.
  - A Pareto Efficiency approach was used to select models that optimize both fairness and accuracy, providing a balanced solution to the trade-offs observed in earlier methods.
